<p>glaxiclean is a green cleaning company based in 
    northern NJ. I was tasked with creating a brand new identity, website, and buisiness card. 
    The brand revolves around the swirling motion one maks when cleaning a service, as well as the idea of clearing up .</p>
    <p>Glaxiclean, a company dedicated 
        to cleaning services, faced significant challenges in its operations. 
        It grappled with consistently low sales figures, a struggle to reach potential clients, 
        and the need to stand out in a crowded home cleaning market. To address these issues effectively,
         our strategy centered around highlighting Glaxicleanâ€™s commitment to eco-friendly practices, positioning 
         it as a safe and sustainable alternative to conventional cleaning services. Additionally, we dedicated 
         substantial effort to crafting a distinctive brand identity that would set Glaxiclean apart from its 
         competitors.</p>
