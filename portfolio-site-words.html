    <p>post-streetwear,\: how a revolution ends.<br>





        <p id="poststreet">Fashion is an expression of cultural values and a speedy one at that
        streetwear was a manifestation of hype but also of global capital and of populism
        in post streetwear, we can find the coming order</p>
        
      <p> what we find is a reactionary turn similar to what we find in the 80s and 50s.
        A movement of progression and leftism is crushed by a return to form of bourgois style
        what this implies is that the 2020s will be a era of consolidation and conservatism. Similar to the 2000s and the 80s</p>
        
        
        Unlike streetwears populist loudness, its self branding, its advertising post streetwear is a return to form of classical forms and archetypes much more significant than a brand name. What post streetwear upholds is not a brand, but a class. A lifestyle ethos.the bourgoies lifestyle
        Streetwear serves as personal branding on a mass, popular scale.
        Streewear is andy warhol. The idea that looking good is something available and open to everyone
        and not just people from a place or time. Streetwear borrows heavily from lower class or working class cultures. Skate style, hip hop, punk rock, rave, etc
        Youth culture and the grimy underground made cool is what streetwear is
        Its the inversion. Instead of making the underground something to aspire to, it steals from the underground to regenerate a lost style, the classical bourgois.
        the 2000s looking back, were an era of conservatism
        this could be seen in its design (called new modernism) which rejected the loudness and individuality of the 90s,
        
        
        its music which was dominated by post punk revivalism and commercial gangsta rap (qua the experimental 90s and socialy conscious rap of the 80s and early 90s) 2010s were an era of social and political strife and reformism. 
        It saw the rise of the internet, and consequently of streetwear and rapid bifurcation of the culture industry post 2008 meltdown.
        The 2020s will be a clamp down to this in a return to the 00s. As a response to crises and global meltdown, the state and culture writ large tend to lurch backwards because people are pussies.
        What is likely to happen to outrage culture? In the 00s, there wasnt necesarrily a backlash against social movements as much as a large forgetting of them. This will likely happen in the 00s. We will forget about blm feminism, imwith her etc. for the time being anyway
        given that the pandemic has introduced a huge number of artificial constraints to the economy, the economy is very likely to soar after covid ends totally. 
        Ironically enough the new ronald reagan would not be donald trump. It would be joe biden.
        
        When I say classical right wing ideas, I mean social conservatism. Economic populism and isolationism is likely to increase. For better or worse, it seems the future of the right is it's past. Before neoliberalism.
        
        right wingers dont get that the bourgois are a class
